# smplFetch üçé
a simple python fetch script for linux.
with some cool art :)*

## How is it differnt from other fetch scripts?
Even though this script was made only for me it still has some cool things I wanted to share, like the randomly genereated matrix art.

## Compatability
It only works on linux as for right now, but I may add support for windows some time later if I have time.

## Rebuilds?
Yes, I will probably rebuilding another version of this script in C once I have fully learned it.

___Also maybe in Rust if I feel up to it...___
